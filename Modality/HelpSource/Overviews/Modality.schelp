Section:: Introduction

Modality is a toolkit created by a team of developers and users of SuperCollider.

One of its basic ideas is to simplify the creation of your very personal instruments with SuperCollider, using controllers of many different kinds. To this end, a common code interface, MKtl, is used for connecting  controllers from different sources (and protocols) like HID and MIDI and OSC.

A second starting point is that the same physical interfaces (sets of sliders, buttons, motion sensors etc etc) can be used for many different purposes, and a highly modal approach to mapping and on-the-fly remapping can help to make a setup much more flexible, powerful, and interesting to play. For example, when improvising with acoustic musicians, highly modal interfaces allow much faster changes of overall (performing) direction.

Find many tutorial files and examples of common use cases of MKtl here:

Also, many description files have little examples for their device:

SECTION:: Overview

With code::MKtl:: it is possible to assign functionality to controller elements.

To find your device, evaluate
code::
MKtl.find;
::

NOTE:: You may have to install drivers before code::MKtl.find:: is able to find your device. Some devices may show up as multiple protocols. Example: the code::ICON IControls:: show up as both code::MIDI:: and code::HID::.::

Each code::MKtl:: has elements such as sliders or knobs. It is possible to assign an action to such an element that is evaluated every time the value of that element gets updated.

Below two examples of what you can do with this toolkit. For further explanation, refer to link::Tutorials/ModalityTutorial::.

subsection:: Example NanoKontrol2

code::
// plug in your NanoKontrol2 and evaluate this line.
k = MKtl('nk2', "korg-nanokontrol2");

// or do this first, grab the last line pasted,
MKtl.find(\midi);
// and change the name:
k = MKtl('myNK2', "korg-nanokontrol2");

// turn on trace, then move some elements to see that the nano works
k.trace;
k.trace(false);

// If no such controller is connected, you can still open
// a gui controller instead that has the same elements:
k.gui;

// make sure there are no current assigned actions
k.reset;

// boot the server
s.boot;

(
// play a sound
x = {
	Splay.ar(
		SinOsc.ar([
			\freq1.kr(700, lag: 0.3),
			\freq2.kr(150, lag: 0.3),
			\freq3.kr(100, lag: 0.3)
	]))/3
}.play;

// add specs for the controls
Spec.add(\freq1, [100, 1000, \exp]);
Spec.add(\freq2, \freq1);
Spec.add(\freq3, \freq1);
)

// set actions to the first three sliders
k.elementAt(\sl, 0).action = {arg el;
	x.set(\freq1, \freq1.asSpec.map(el.value))
};
k.elementAt(\sl, 1).action = {arg el;
	x.set(\freq2, \freq2.asSpec.map(el.value))
};
k.elementAt(\sl, 2).action = {arg el;
	x.set(\freq3, \freq3.asSpec.map(el.value))
};


// after testing, free sound
x.free;

// and free the device
k.free;

subsection:: Example BCR2000

code::
// plug in your BCR2000 and evaluate this line.
k = MKtl('myBCR', "behringer-bcr2000");

// turn on trace, then move some elements to see that the nano works
k.trace;
k.trace(false);

// If no such controller is connected, you can still open
// a gui controller instead that has the same elements:
k.gui;

// make sure there are no current assigned actions
k.reset;

// dictionary of controls keys to MKtlElements
k.elements;

// elements can be accessed through a hierarchy:
k.elementAt(\kn, 0, 0);

// all knobs of the first row
k.elementAt(\kn, 0); // -> MKtlElementGroup

// elements have a type:
k.elementAt(\kn, 0, 0).type;

// select elements by their type:
k.elementsDict.select { |x| x.type == \encoder };

// perform an action on turning knob [0,0] (upper left)
k.elementAt(\kn, 0, 0).action = { |el| el.value.postln };

// boot the server
s.boot;

// simple sound example
x = { Splay.ar(RLPF.ar(Saw.ar(\freq.kr(440, 0.1), mul: 0.1), 1000))}.play;

// .action overrides previously set actions
(
k.elementAt(\kn, 0, 0).action_({ |el|
	x.set(\freq, el.value.linlin(0.0, 1, 300.0, 600));
});
)

// after testing, free sound
x.free;

// send data back to the device
k.elementAt(\kn,0,0).value_(0.5);

// remove all assigned actions
k.reset;

subsection::Bonus: Knob rotation demo
code::
(
d = 0;
{
	loop {
		0.05.wait;
		d = d + 0.01;
		8.do { |i|
			k.elementAt(\kn, 0, i).value_(
				(d + (i/7)).mod(1.0);
			);
		};
	}
}.fork;
)

SECTION:: Controllers not yet recognised

Have a controller that is not yet known to the system? You can fix this by yourself!
To do so, look at link::Tutorials/How_to_create_a_description_file::.
