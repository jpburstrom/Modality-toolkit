TITLE:: OSCMKtlDevice
summary::  The Modality class for creating and accessing OSC controllers
categories:: Libraries>Modality, External Control
related:: Overviews/Modality, Classes/MKtl, Classes/MKtlDevice, Classes/MKtlElement

DESCRIPTION::
OSCMKtlDevice provides an easy to use interface for OSC devices or interfaces that send data to your computer.

For most devices or interfaces, this requires that someone has already made a description file for the device; if there is none, it is easy to make one following the instructions here:
link::Tutorials/How_to_create_a_description_file:: and here: link::Tutorials/How_to_create_a_description_file_for_OSC::

More general info can be found in link::Classes/MKtl:: and link::Classes/MKtlDevice:: .


CLASSMETHODS::

private:: initialized, sourceDeviceDict, deinitDevices

METHOD:: find
Find all currently opened OSC devices.

argument:: post
Whether or not to post about the OSC devices.

METHOD:: postPossible
Post all access code for device that could be used by name.

METHOD:: protocol
protocol name, \osc.


METHOD:: initDevices
Initialize the sourceDeviceDict and look for available OSC devices.

argument:: force
Whether or not to do this again if it was already done before.


METHOD:: new

Creates a new instance of OSCMKtlDevice.

argument:: name
The short name of the controller as it shows up in the list of found devices.

argument:: devInfo
The device code::idInfo:: to use to make the OSC connections.

argument:: parentMKtl
The instance of link::Classes/MKtl:: that this MKtlDevice will belong to.



INSTANCEMETHODS::

private:: initOSCMKtl

METHOD:: initElements
Initilize all elements and set OSCFuncs for them

METHOD:: initCollectives
Initilize all collectives and set OSCFuncs for them

METHOD:: oscFuncDictionary
A Dictionary containing all the OSCFuncs that this device is using.

METHOD:: closeDevice
Free all OSCFuncs.

METHOD:: cleanupElementsAndCollectives
De-initialize all elements and collectives.


METHOD:: send
Send the value of the element or collective to the OSC device; called if you set the value of an MKtlElement that is an output.

argument:: key
The key of the element or collective.

argument:: val
The value to which it is set. A collective should send an Array.


METHOD:: source
The link::Classes/NetAddr:: device that is the source for this OSCMKtlDevice.

returns:: an instance of link::Classes/NetAddr::

METHOD:: destination
The link::Classes/NetAddr:: device that is the destination for this OSCMKtlDevice.

returns:: an instance of link::Classes/NetAddr::

METHOD:: recvPort
The port to which the OSC device/interface is sending data to. If this is configurable in the OSC device or interface, then it is easier to use sclang's default port of 57120 and leave it undefined.
