TITLE:: MIDIExplorer
summary:: Explore a MIDI device
categories:: Libraries>Modality
related::  Overviews/Modality, Classes/MKtl, Classes/MIDIMKtlDevice, Reference/MKtl_description_files

DESCRIPTION::
The functionality of link::Classes/MKtl:: relies on descriptions of the used devices. For some Controllers, and while many descriptions are already available, your device may not yet be among them.
With MIDIExplorer, it is easy to create such a file for a MIDI device.
For more info on how to use it, see  link::Tutorials/How_to_create_a_description_file::.

code::
MKtl.find(\midi);

// to pick a specific device you want to explore:
MIDIExplorer.postSrcInfo;

// and enter its uid here
MIDIExplorer.start( -476939297  );

// or to get the uid of e.g. the first connected MIDI device:
MIDIClient.sources[0].uid.postln;
MIDIExplorer.start(MIDIClient.sources[0].uid);

// if only a single device is connected, you can also just do
MIDIExplorer.start;

// check we are listening to the intended device only:
MIDIExplorer.observedSrcID;
MIDIExplorer.deviceName;


// now play with all elements to generate info for the device.
// To get info for every incoming control, do:
MIDIExplorer.verbose = true;
// to post only an overview/count when a new one comes in:
MIDIExplorer.verbose = false;

// if no more new controllers are found, do:
MIDIExplorer.openDoc;
MIDIExplorer.compile;



// and save here:
MKtlDesc.openFolder;

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: postSrcInfo
post info on currently available sources, mainly to access uid number.

METHOD:: start
start exploration, i.e. collecting statistics on all incoming MIDI messages.

ARGUMENT:: srcID
an optional source ID - if not nil, only messages from the identified source will be collected.

METHOD:: postObs
post info on the current state of observation

METHOD:: stop
stop exploration.

METHOD:: deviceName
find the deviceName for the observed srcID

METHOD:: instructions
return instructions string to put on top of desc file.

MIDIExplorer.instructions

METHOD:: compile
compile the discovered elements as an evaluable string, which can be saved as a description file, and then read as a description dict.

ARGUMENT:: includeSpecs

returns:: a String containing a a dict which works as a description, and contains raw list of elements

METHOD:: openDoc
opens a new document containing a description string made with MIDIExplorer.compile.

METHOD:: compileDesc
compile the elementsDesc from data collected by MIDIExplorer.

METHOD:: verbose
get and set flag whether to post info
METHOD:: trace
set verbose flag, default flag is true

METHOD:: allMsgTypes
list of midi message types to catch

private:: observeDict, observedSrcID, prepareObserve, resps, totalSum, updateRange, results
